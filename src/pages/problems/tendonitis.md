# Tendonitis

## Signs & Symptons

Tendonitis is inflammation of a tendon, which can cause pain in the affected area. It can affect tendons around the shoulder, elbow, wrist, finger, thigh, knee or back of the heel.

Tendonitis is caused by overusing a tendon or injuring it, for example during sport. Tendonitis is quite common and can affect anyone, but particularly adults who do a lot of sports. Also, tendons lose their elasticity and become weaker over time, making tendonitis more likely in the elderly.

## Causes

Tendonitis is caused by overuse of a tendon or injury. It may be the result of:

- a sports-related injury
- a repetitive strain injury, which can occur in the workplace.

## Treatment

- Ordinary painkillers such as a Paracetamol may help to relieve the pain.
- Stop doing the activity that caused the condition, such as sport or typing, or at least reduce it. This will help prevent any further inflammation or damage. It is important to rest the affected area. This will allow the inflammation to settle. Some form of support, such as a bandage, splint or brace, may be helpful as this will reduce movement.
- Clinical studies and field research verify the value of orthotics in relieving tendonitis and improving structural integrity. Flexible orthotics control foot and leg motion without restricting function and creating compensatory movement in other structures.
