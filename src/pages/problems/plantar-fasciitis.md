# Plantar Fasciitis

## Signs & Symptons

Heel pain which is usually on the inside of the foot and feels worst first thing in the morning, after a few minutes it eases as the foot gets warmed up, but can get worse again during the day especially if walking a lot.

Sometimes pain occurs on the outside of the heel, but this is often as a result of offloading the painful area on the inside.

## Treatment

- Rest from aggravating activities
- Anti-inflammatory preparations or cold therapy to help reduce pain and inflammation.
- Stretching the calf muscles and plantar fascia.
- Insoles/Orthoses (See a Podiatrist)
