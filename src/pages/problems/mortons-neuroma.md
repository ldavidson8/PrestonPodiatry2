# Mortons Neuroma

## Signs & Symptons

It can present as a burning pain under the ball of the foot, sometimes radiating to the toes and causing numbness.
Pain is often worse on walking, especially in tight fitting shoes, and can be relieved by resting and removing the shoes.

Squeezing the forefoot together from the sides can cause a painful click. The pain is due to a compression of the digital nerves most commonly between the 3rd and 4th metatarsals.
Treatment is more effective if started early while the symptoms are mild.

## Treatment

- Footwear â€“ Avoid high heels and choose wide fitting shoes
- Padding to cushion
- Insole/Orthotic to spread the metatarsals and prevent the compression of the nerve. (See a Podiatrist)
- Cortisone Injection
