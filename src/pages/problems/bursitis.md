# Bursitis

## Signs & Symptons

Any site that has been exposed to mechanical stress such as shear and friction is likely to become inflamed resulting in the inflammation of a bursa. There is usually visible swelling and tenderness over the affected area. Common sites for bursitis

- Medial aspect first metatarsal head (outside of the big toe)
- Lateral side of 5th metatarsal (outside of the 5th toe)
- Dorsal interphalangeal joints (top of the toes)
- Retrocalcaneal area (back of the heel)

## Treatment

- Anti-inflammatory preparations
- Therapeutic Ultrasound
- If bursitis is infected then antibiotics are required
- Change ill-fitting shoe to avoid rubbing
- Use of protective padding or gel materials to reduce stress on tissues
- Orthoses to correct any biomechanical abnormality (See a Podiatrist)
