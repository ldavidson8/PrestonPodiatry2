# Bunions

## Signs & Symptons

This is the term used to describe the formation of a bony bump on the side of the big toe. As a result of this change in alignment the big toe joint does not function as effectively and can result in pain in the big toe joint or corns or callus developing under the ball of the foot. The main factors which predispose someone to the development of bunions are Heredity, Footwear, Gender and excessive pronation of the foot.

## Treatment

- Protective padding
- Orthotics to control excessive pronation and improve foot function (See a Podiatrist)
