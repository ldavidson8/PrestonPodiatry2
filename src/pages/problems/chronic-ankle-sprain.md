# Chronic Ankle Sprain

## Signs & Symptons

Pain is normally present around the outside of the ankle and can feel weak as if going to give way when walking.
This can be a result of a residual instability in the ankle joint.

## Treatment

- Strengthening and proprioception exercises
- Use an ankle strapping or support
- Orthotics to improve lower limb alignment and stability
