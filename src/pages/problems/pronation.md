# Pronation

## Signs & Symptons

Pronation is a normal foot motion. Normal pronation, or "turning inward" of the foot is necessary as the foot adapts to the ground. One of the most common causes of foot and leg discomfort is a condition known as excessive/ over pronation.

With excessive pronation/over pronation, the arch flattens, collapses, and soft tissues stretch. This causes the joint surfaces to function at unnatural angles to each other. When this happens, joints that should be stable now become very loose and flexible.

At first, excess pronation may cause fatigue. As the problem gets worse, strain on the muscles, tendons, and ligaments of the foot and lower leg can cause permanent problems and deformities.

## Causes

Pronation can be present at birth or develop at an early age, and is often a hereditary condition. In some people, however, pronation develops as a symptom of foot abuse from any of the following factors:

- Weakened muscles due to aging or heavy strain placed on the feet may cause pronation.
- Standing or walking for long periods in high heels can lead to pronation.
- Wearing shoes that don't provide proper arch support may be a contributing factor to the development of pronation.

## Treatment

Custom Pronation orthotics provide a unique foot support system that aligns the lower body. The major cause of foot and leg pain is over pronation which causes excessive pressure on the muscles, ligaments and bones of the lower body. Pronation orthotics treat the underlying cause of over pronation and prevent future occurrences of the associated foot or leg condition.

Regular stretching of the feet, ankles and legs ensures overall flexibility and suppleness. These exercises increase blood flow and reduce the extra stress and tightness brought on by excessive pronation.
