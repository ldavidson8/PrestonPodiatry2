# Flat Feet

## Signs & Symptons

Flat feet is a condition in which the foot doesn't have a normal arch.
It may affect one foot or both feet. Most people have a gap between in the inner side of the foot and the ground when they are standing. This is referred to as an "arch".
Feet that have a low arch or no arch at all are referred to as flat feet or fallen arches.

On standing the patient will have a flat arch and the foot may roll over to the inner aspect.
The symptoms vary depending on the severity of the condition. Individuals may experience corns and hard skin under the sole of the foot.

The arch area may be tender and shoes will tend to wear out quickly.
In severe cases the patient may experience calf, knee, hip and back pain.

## Causes

Painful flat feet in children may be caused by a condition called tarsal coalition.
Tarsal coalition is a condition where two or more of the bones in the foot fuse together, limiting motion and often leading to a flat foot.

Flat feet can also be caused by fallen arches.
Years of wear and tear can weaken the tendon that is responsible for shaping the arch.
Fallen arches can also be caused by injury such as inflammation of the tendons in the foot.

## Treatment

Flat Feet can be effectively treated with orthotics that provide biomechanical support and help feet to function more efficiently.

The most effective orthotics are those which are custom made to fit your foot. The orthotic should provide both support for the longitudinal arch and medial rear foot posting to combat over pronation. Orthotics should be combined with supportive footwear that fits the foot correctly and contains a firm, low heel.

In the most extreme circumstances the Podiatrist may suggest Surgery, but this would only be if all treatment options had been exhausted.
