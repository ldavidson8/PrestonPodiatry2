# Haglunds Bump

## Signs & Symptons

Haglunds heel bumps are formations of bony material that appear on the back of the heels. As the bony enlargement develops a small fluid filled sac can also develop which is called a bursa.

When this sac becomes inflamed a condition called bursitis can occur which is very painful in most cases. It may also cause sensitivity and inflammation of the surrounding tissues such as those associated with the Achilles tendon. They can appear on either foot or both equally.

## Causes

The deformities may be caused by the gait of the person as those who have a tendency to walk on the outer side off the heel may find they are more susceptible to the condition.
It is also thought that genetics may play a role as the bone structures may be common amongst family members and generations.

## Treatment

Initially the condition may be treated conservatively as this is less invasive and means the person is less likely to suffer side effects and complications of invasive methods. Pain relief, rest and ice application may help to reduce the discomfort, redness and swelling of the area which may be enough to ease the condition during flare-ups.

Those with hereditary problems such as high arches may find that orthotic devices such as heel pads or shoe inserts may help as this will relieve many of the problems associated with high arches.

Soft shoes and those that do not contain hard or constricting backs may help as these will allow the foot and heel to assume their natural shape incorporating the additional bony structure that is a Haglunds bump.

For those who have not had any success with these methods or those whose bump protrudes quite significantly surgery may be recommended.
