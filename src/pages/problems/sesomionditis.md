# Sesomionditis

## Signs & Symptons

Gradual onset of pain under the big toe joint on weight-bearing, particularly when the big toe joint is flexed upwards (Dorsiflexed).

The pain can start as a mild ache and gradually increase to an intense throbbing if the aggravating activity is continued. Tenderness may be localised to one or both of the sesamoids and callus may be present over the big toe joint.
It is usually a result of repetitive stress and compression on the sesamoid and big toe joint, rather than an acute injury, leading to inflammation.

## Treatment

- Rest
- Anti-inflammatory medication
- Padding to reduce pressure on the painful area
- Strapping to immobilize the big toe.
- Insole/Orthotic to correct any biomechanical abnormality and reduce pressure on the sesamoids
