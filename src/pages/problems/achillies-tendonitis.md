# Achillies Tendonities

## Signs & Symptons

Initially pain or stiffness can be felt first thing in the morning or after activity. Swelling can be felt above the heel and pain can be elicited by plantar-flexing the foot or standing on tip toes. This condition often occurs in either people who are increasing their level of training or those who have changed the surface on which they are training.

## Treatment

- Rest from sporting activity
- Use Ice or Anti-inflammatory preparations
- Avoid stretching the calf muscles until the pain and inflammation has gone
- Avoid shoes with high heel counters to prevent irritation to the Achilles tendon.
- Orthotics to correct any underlying Biomechanical problem such as excessive pronation. (See a Podiatrist for a biomechanical assessment)
