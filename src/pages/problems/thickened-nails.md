# Thickened Nails

## Signs & Symptons

Thickened nails are also known as Onychauxis nails. This is an abnormal thickening of the nail which is quite a common condition.

The big toenail is the most commonly affected. Cutting the nail becomes very difficult and pressure from shoes can cause this condition to become painful.

## Causes

- A major trauma or repeated pressure from shoes on long nails.
- Fungal infection of the nails or skin diseases.
- Poor circulation, particulary in elderly people.

## Treatment

It is essential that thickened nails are managed with routine chiropody treatment. A podiatrist can reduce the thickness of the nails and keep them to a reasonable length.
