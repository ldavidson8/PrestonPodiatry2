# Hammer Toe

## Signs & Symptons

A hammer toe can be best described as an abnormal contraction or "buckling" of a toe. This occurs due to a partial or complete dislocation of one of the joints that form the toe.
As the toe continues to be deformed, it will press up against the shoe and may cause corns. If the deformity occurs in the lesser toes and in the joint nearest the foot, it is called a hammer toe.

## Causes

There are various causes of Hammer Toes:

- Inappropriate shoes.
- Flat feet can result in hammer toes.
- High arched feet can also result in buckling toes.
- A major cause is in hereditary (family), all the toe conditions mentioned could be acquired due to hereditary factors.
- Bunions are a major cause of hammer toes.

## Treatment

If your toe is still flexible, your doctor may recommend that you change to roomier and more comfortable footwear and that you wear orthotics.

Wearing orthotics can reposition your toe and relieve pressure and pain.
